# Transitions and Animations

Animations are built up of many transitions

Transitions are a timed change of one value in one direction
e.g. 0 to 255 in 3 seconds
or 50 to 51 in 10 seconds.

Animations are a set of ordered transitions that can occur either simultaneously or after the finish of a previous transition

delays can be applied at any stage
e.g. transition 3 starts with previous after 1 second delay
or transition 5 starts after previous after 5 second delay
